    "en": "FreeRossDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization DAO formed by PleasrDAO to reform the injustice of prisons and gain freedom for Ross, the inventor and builder of the Silk Road.
The Silk Road made more people aware of Bitcoin, and many cryptocurrency bigwigs also learned about Bitcoin's existence through the dark web. Li Qiwei, the founder of Litecoin, tweeted that he learned about Bitcoin and blockchain from the dark web Silk Road.
FreeRossDAO won the auction for that NFT for 1,446 Ether (about $6 million) after raising more than 2,836.6 ETH from more than 1,320 members of the cryptocurrency community. It now plans to use the proceeds to fund a bid to reduce or overturn Ross' life sentence. freeRossDAO received a strategic investment from A16Z on the first day of the release of its community governance token, $FREE, from its launch organization, PleasrDAO.",
